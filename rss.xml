<description>I have found a very cool dmenu script That looks for applications instead of /usr/bin that dmenu_run uses. if you are gonna use this insted of dmenu_run than just moved dmenu_applications into dmenu src folder than remove dmenu_run and rename dmenu_applications to dmenu_run.</description>

<description>Hello everyone! This is the first (and hopefully not last) article on this blog. If you want to know a bit more [about](https://t9.no/about.html) me, you can read, well, the about me page. For anyone interested in how the blog’s hosted - the footer should have appropriate information, but in case it doesn’t: I’ve used [blogit](https://pedantic.software/git/blogit/) as a baseline, although I modified it to suit my needs. I plan to host my own git server; as soon as I do that, I’ll just share the code there.</description>
